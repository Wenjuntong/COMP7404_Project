# COMP7404_Project
In this work, we reproduce the Unsupervised Learning on the Health and Retirement
Study using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Hierarchical Clustering
on a new data set related to obesity. We aim to uncover the underlying patterns
among individuals based on categorical survey responses related to diet, physical
activity, and demographic factors. We utilize MCA for dimensionality reduction
followed by hierarchical clustering to identify distinct groups. By visualizing and
clustering individuals based on their MCA projections, we observe distinct clusters
corresponding to different health risks
